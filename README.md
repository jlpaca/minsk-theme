> a theme in deep muted greens. for [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).

**Minsk** is a low-ish-contrast theme on a restricted palette.  It tries to be almost-monochrome, and most of the time prefers highlighting by font style over by colour, though it isn't excessively strict about wiggling a little in hue-space.

Far from exhaustive â€” [feedback](https://github.com/jlpaca/minsk-theme/issues/new) and [contributions](https://github.com/jlpaca/minsk-theme/compare) would be most welcome.
