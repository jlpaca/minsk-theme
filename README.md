**Minsk** is a low-ish-contrast theme on a restricted palette,
intended for generic everyday use.  It tries to be almost-monochrome,
and most of the time prefers highlighting by font style over by
colour, though it isn't excessively strict about wiggling a little in
hue-space.

Support for various modes far from exhaustive â€”
[feedback](https://github.com/jlpaca/minsk-theme/issues/new) and
[contributions](https://github.com/jlpaca/minsk-theme/compare) would
be most welcome.
